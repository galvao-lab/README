## What is it?

This is an org created to be a hub of repositories that aren't necessarily projects. They are ideas, experiments, tests, unconventional codes, etc... 

It's a sort of sandbox of things I play with. They might become something in the future or they might just sit here "forever" :simple_smile:

Available repos:

* [TicTacToe](https://github.com/galvao-lab/tictactoe) - A pure HTML-CSS-JS implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game

## Who?!

My name is [Er Galvao Abbott](https://www.galvao.eti.br). I'm a 25+ years programmer, teacher and public speaker who've been working with web-interfaced applications.

## What can I do with the repos here?

You may pretty much do whatever you want with them as long as you give me the proper credit (see about the license below).

Please enjoy and happy coding! :simple_smile:

## License

All repositories under this org are MIT-licensed. All I ask of you is that if you use any of the code on these repos you put a link to this very repository - https://github.com/galvao-lab/README -  so more people can find them.
